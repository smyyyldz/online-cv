      - title: Liquidity Constraints in Healthcare Expenditure
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "Liquidity constraints restrain consumption smoothing ability of optimizing households.
        This paper evaluates the heterogeneous impact of liquidity constraints on healthcare spending decisions
        and compares it with non-health consumption  in particular with food consumption.
        I show that households deviate from unconstrained level of optimal healthcare spending by the binding liquidity constraints
        in the current period as well as expected binding constraints one period ahead. In a linearized Euler equation current
        binding constraints causes negative bias on income which is predicted to have no impact on consumption growth
        by permanent income hypothesis, whereas expected binding constraints leads to a positive bias.
        In the test, the resulting bias depends on which effect is stronger. Moreover, income elasticity of health-care consumption
        varies significantly between asset poor and rich families, and more than the elasticity of non-health consumption,
        in particular of food consumption, among wealth quintiles, a finding that is supportive of heterogeneous impact of the binding liquidity constraints. "

      - title: History-Dependent Present Bias
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Liquidity constraints and present-biased preferences are considered as alternative explanations for the non-optimal household decisions
        especially among the poor. I propose a model where present bias arises endogenously.
        Time inconsistency arises due to a lasting effect of binding constraints onto the preferences
        which alter the optimal decision more than one period even for nondurable goods.
        The model serves as a micro foundation for the quasi-hyperbolic discounting for the ever-constrained households.
        The bias term is updated slowly based on the credit history which results in heterogeneity in the degree of present-bias among households."

      - title: Welfare Implications of Competition in a Vertical Market Structure A Case of Accumulator Industry
        link: "https://sumeyyeyildiz.com/pdfs/Sumeyye_acu.pdf"
        authors: Sümeyye Yıldız
        conference: M.A. Thesis, Boğaziçi University
        tagline: "The accumulator industry exhibits a typical example of a vertical market structure,
        where waste accumulators are collected, then recycled in order to extract lead, which is subsequently
        used as the main input in the production of new accumulators. Through a theoretical model the thesis analyzes
        the welfare implications of the extent of competition in such a market structure. It replicates the well-known result that
        there is an incentive for firms to vertically integrate; yet also shows that enforcing competition is not welfare-enhancing."
