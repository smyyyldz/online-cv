        tagline: "Income elasticity of health-care consumption varies significantly
        between asset poor and rich families, and more than the elasticity of non-health consumption,
        in particular of food consumption, among wealth quintiles. 
        For liquidity constrained households, bad health crowds out to non-health consumption
        and restrains consumption smoothing ability of optimizing households."
